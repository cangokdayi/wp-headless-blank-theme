# WP Headless Theme

Dead-simple blank WordPress theme for headless WP projects. 

It just renders a dummy JSON object leaving you worry-free about the useless static stuff that WP Core & plugins might load on page.

It can also be configured to render HTML with the `responseType` constant inside `functions.php`

HTML Output:

JSON Output:

Assets folder is completely unnecessary unless you're rendering HTML and need it so delete it if you like.
