# WP Headless Theme

Dead-simple blank WordPress theme for headless WP Gods. 

It can also return HTML page with the `responseType` constant inside `functions.php` but I wouldn't recommend it unless you really have to. Think about the amount of time you'll waste while waiting for the html output and http requests when you can just serve a simple JSON response and be done with it.

HTML Output:

JSON Output:

Assets folder is completely unnecessary unless you're rendering HTML and need it so delete it if you like.
